# Investigate-patients-skipping-medical-appointments
Investigate factors that affect whether or not a patient misses their medical appointment

## Introduction

This Udacity training project will use data collected on 100 000 medical appointments in Brazil with the aim to analyse what factors 
influence a patient showing up or not showing up for their medical appointment.
Some questions that will be looked at are whether or not patients that are enrolled in the Brasilian welfare program (scholarship) tend 
to miss their appointments or not. This analysis will also look at the effect and/or role that age and gender have on showing up for an 
appointment as well as if receiving an SMS has an effect.

## Technologies

Python 2.7 or 3.6
